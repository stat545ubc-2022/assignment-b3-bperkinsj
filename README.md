# Assignment B3 (& B4): An updated BC Liquors App

Welcome to the repository for my assignments B3 and B4! For this assignment, I decided to update the BC Liquors app created by Dean Attali. There are 7 features including 3 inputs and 3 outputs:

#### Inputs

- A price range sliding scale
- A drink type selection
- A country of origin selection

#### Outputs
- A bar plot of the drinks matching the specifications, grouped by price
- A short sentence saying how many drinks fit the specifications
- A table containing the information for the drinks

#### Additional features
- A button to download the drinks table in .csv format.

You can find the app [here](https://brookspj.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-bperkinsj/).

This project uses publicly available data from OpenDataBC that can be found [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-historical-prices).
