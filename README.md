# Assignment B3: An updated BC Liquors App

Welcome to the repository for my assignment B3! For this assignment, I decided to update the BC Liquors app created by Dean Attali. I added three features:

- An interactive table, allowing the user to sort as they desire.
- A text output stating how many drinks were available based on the user's input.
- A download button to download the filtered data generated by the input.

You can find the app [here](https://brookspj.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-bperkinsj/).

This project uses publicly available data from OpenDataBC that can be found [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-historical-prices).
